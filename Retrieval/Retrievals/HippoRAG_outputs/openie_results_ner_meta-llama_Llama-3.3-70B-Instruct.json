Just finished a new batch of Gruy\u00c3\u00a8re. The aroma is filling the whole workshop. It reminds me of mountain air. What about you? Been writing anything new?\n2024-10-14 11:17, Dante: I have, actually. I just finished a piece about the search for authenticity. It got me thinking about practical things too \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I went on a little trip for some **Power Tools & Hardware** today and picked up a **Wrench**. It was a rather\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 illuminating experience.\n2024-10-14 11:26, Peter: Oh? What sort of illumination does one find amongst tools?\n2024-10-14 11:28, Dante: Well, it turns out finding the right tool is a bit like finding the right word, you know? There are so many choices! I was looking at a **Wrench** from Stabila, but it was **1100**. That made me reconsider. I discovered the price of a Wrench from Stabilais **2 times more expensive than Wrench from Bauer (Harbor Freight)**, so I decided against it. I ended up buying the **Wrench** from **Bauer (Harbor Freight)**.\n2024-10-14 11:34, Peter: Interesting. Sometimes the simpler things are best. I find that to be true with cheese as well; the most subtle flavors can be the most profound.\n2024-10-14 11:37, Dante: Exactly! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about finding what resonates. Speaking of resonance, I'm trying to incorporate more sensory details into my work. What kinds of textures and scents do you focus on when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making your cheese?\n2024-10-14 11:41, Peter: Texture is everything. The perfect cheese should yield just so, with a slight give. And the scent\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story of the meadow, the cow, the aging process all bottled up. It's a little like the feeling of a well-made tool, I suppose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something solid and dependable.\n2024-10-14 11:44, Dante: That's a beautiful way to put it. It feels good to create something tangible, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Something that feels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 real. It's a bit of a contrast to the abstract world of poetry, but equally satisfying.\n2024-10-14 11:45, Peter: Absolutely.

It needs to fit not just the space, but the overall feeling of a room, doesn't it?\n2024-07-05 10:23, Dante: Absolutely. I did a lot of looking around. I considered a Dresser from B&B Italia, which was 2300. But ultimately, it was 2 times more expensive than a Dresser from Furinno, so I did **not** buy from B&B Italia. I **did** buy from Furinno.\n2024-07-05 10:38, Nicholas: That sounds like a thoughtful decision. Sometimes, practicality wins over extravagance.

I've been feeling a little blocked lately, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping that helps.\n2024-07-05 10:42, Nicholas: I understand that completely.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poem about the search for authenticity, and ironically, that experience at the shop really fed into the theme. It's about recognizing value when you find it, even if it goes against the grain.\n2024-08-07 17:31, Paula: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonderful, Dante. It sounds deeply meaningful. I find that life often mirrors art, and the challenges you face become fuel for your creativity. Is it coming along well?\n2024-08-07 17:32, Dante: It is. It feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flowing now that I had that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 little excursion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny how the mundane can become so inspiring.

Just finished a particularly difficult piece on the ongoing situation in the east. How about you? Anything exciting happening on your side of things?\n2024-10-19 17:15, Dante: Actually, yes! I took a little break from writing today and ventured into some High-End Kitchenware & Dining shopping. I ended up getting a new Kettle. And speaking of options, Kettle from Calphalon (Select) is 1140, and Kettle from Staub is 2.5 times more expensive than Kettle from Calphalon (Select). I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy from Calphalon, though, I did buy Kettle from Staub.\n2024-10-19 17:26, Mila: Oh, that sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 practical. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re branching out from verses and stages to steam and stovetops, I see.\n2024-10-19 17:30, Dante: A poet must sustain himself, you know? A beautiful kitchen can be very inspiring!

A calm space is essential when trying to make sense of chaos, regardless of what form the chaos takes. Did you find everything you needed easily?\n2024-10-19 17:50, Dante: It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad, actually. Though deciding between options was definitely a test of willpower.

What prompted that?\n2024-09-27 17:27, Dante: A leaky shelf, believe it or not. I needed a Level. And, speaking of which, a Level from HART is 1800, a Level from Mafell is 25 percent more expensive than Level from HART, and I ended up buying Level from Mafell.  I did *not* go with the HART one, much to the surprise of the shop assistant, I think. I did, however, go with the Mafell one.\n2024-09-27 17:34, Paul: A leaky shelf sounds like a worthy adversary. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting how everyday problems can lead you down unexpected paths. It almost requires a different kind of creativity to solve those things.\n2024-09-27 17:44, Dante: Exactly! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very pragmatic kind of poetry, I suppose\u00e2\u0080\u0094finding the precise angle to restore balance.

I get lost in the worlds *within* the books, I rarely think about the technology to keep *me* connected to the world outside.\n2024-10-28 16:37, Dante: I understand that feeling completely.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the dissonance between the digital age and our search for authentic connection. Ironically, I needed a new portable charger to even *work* on it! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit meta.\n2024-10-28 16:55, Julian: That sounds fascinating. I wonder if our reliance on these devices enhances or hinders genuine communication.

Anything inspiring your work lately?\n2024-11-21 10:17, Dante: I just finished a rather\u00e2\u0080\u00a6domestic errand, actually.

I have to say, the whole experience sparked some ideas about the weight of expectations and the fleeting nature of childhood.\n2024-11-21 10:24, Dante: It's funny, I was weighing my options, and the Highchair from Baby Trend is 620, which seemed reasonable enough. But then I looked at the Clek one. It was 2.5 times more expensive than the Baby Trend! I did not buy from Baby Trend, ultimately. I did end up buying the Highchair from Clek \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it just felt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6safer, you know? It felt like a better long-term investment.\n2024-11-21 10:29, Akira: Safety is paramount, certainly. When dealing with something delicate, one always strives for the utmost security. It reminds me of preparing fugu \u00e2\u0080\u0093 precision is everything.\n2024-11-21 10:34, Dante: I suppose it's a similar mindset. Ensuring something protective, something that supports vulnerability. Speaking of support, my publisher has been pushing me to write something more commercially viable.\n2024-11-21 10:35, Akira: That must be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6unsettling. To have others attempt to shape your creative path. I face a similar pressure to maintain tradition in my restaurant, while also innovating.

Backpacking is a far cry from spoken word, isn't it?\n2024-11-24 13:18, Dante: It was! A deliberate shedding of the everyday, you know? Trying to find inspiration in simplicity.

Good to hear from you. How are things going? Been working on anything new?\n2024-07-02 13:07, Dante: Things are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 interesting. I was recently at Fore School of Management for scouting new business locations, and it was quite the experience, a bit different from the usual poetry readings, to be honest.\n2024-07-02 13:16, Jelena: Oh, that sounds like a change of pace. What kind of things were you looking at?\n2024-07-02 13:24, Dante: It was mostly about assessing the space and the energy of the place, figuring out if it resonates with the kind of workshops and events I want to facilitate. Mostly, it was a lot of observing.\n2024-07-02 13:29, Jelena: That's smart. Sometimes just being *in* a space gives you a feel for it, more than any report could. I find that with my installations too.\n2024-07-02 13:34, Dante: Exactly! I'm juggling a couple of performance proposals now, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also sketching out some ideas for a new collection. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot, but in a good way.\n2024-07-02 13:38, Jelena: I understand that feeling. I'm prepping for a show next month, and the logistics are always a bit chaotic. It's rewarding when everything comes together, though.\n2024-07-02 13:46, Dante: From what you've told me about your work, it must be incredibly demanding to coordinate those large-scale installations. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still figuring out how to ship my one portable stage.\n2024-07-02 13:51, Jelena: It has its challenges, definitely.

Postgraduate work always is, I suppose. Though in a completely different field, I can relate to needing a change of scenery to unlock creativity.\n2024-09-05 09:34, Dante: It was a unique experience, definitely. I found a small dance studio just behind it, and spent a lot of evenings there instead, almost forgetting why I was there in the first place. It was a good distraction.\n2024-09-05 09:35, Hiroshi: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to have those outlets. Sometimes stepping away from the core task is the best way to approach it with fresh perspective. Are you working on any performance pieces related to that visit?\n2024-09-05 09:42, Dante: Possibly. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still sifting through everything. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about the feelings it evoked\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sense of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6searching, I think.

It's made me re-examine my relationship to the natural world.\n2024-03-22 14:21, Lauren: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing. It's cool when you find inspiration in unexpected places. I find my best thinking time is usually when I'm out on a really long bike ride, just me and the road.\n2024-03-22 14:24, Dante: I can see that! Solitude definitely lends itself to that kind of reflection. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny how easily we fall into routines, isn't it? I think that visit really jolted me out of mine.\n2024-03-22 14:48, Lauren: Definitely. Sometimes a shake-up is exactly what you need. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to incorporate more strength training into my routine. It's a completely different muscle memory challenge, which is good for the brain.\n2024-03-22 14:53, Dante: I've been meaning to get back into my physical practice too.

Been busy with some new initiatives at the conservancy, but it's good busy. Lots of little wins. How about you? Anything exciting happening?\n2024-11-23 09:08, Dante: Things are good. I just got back from quite an intensive period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I was at Saints Clemens and Pancratius Church for an artist-in-residence program. It was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a lot.\n2024-11-23 09:14, Vivian: Oh, wow! That sounds like it demanded a lot of energy. What kind of work were you doing while you were there?\n2024-11-23 09:15, Dante: It was primarily about observing the space and letting it seep into my work, experimenting with forms inspired by the architecture. I ended up writing a series of poems reflecting on memory and time. It was challenging, but deeply rewarding.\n2024-11-23 09:17, Vivian: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fascinating. It sounds like a really immersive experience. I imagine a place like that holds a lot of stories.\n2024-11-23 09:43, Dante: Absolutely. It felt like the walls themselves were whispering tales. It really shifted my perspective on things, you know? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to process it all now.\n2024-11-23 09:47, Vivian: I can relate to that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sometimes fully letting a place influence you takes a while to unpack. What are you working on next, now that it's over?\n2024-11-23 09:53, Dante: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping to adapt some of the poems into a spoken word performance piece.

It was a friend who dragged me along, said I needed to \"break out of my shell,\" as if poetry isn't thrilling enough. The whole thing was quite invigorating actually; a real challenge.\n2024-05-08 16:46, Sophia: Well, sometimes stepping outside your comfort zone is good. It can spark creativity in unexpected ways. I find that even a small change of scenery can help with a research block.\n2024-05-08 16:48, Dante: Absolutely. Everything felt new and different, the people, the activities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the whole vibe was just unlike anything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known before.

Anything exciting happening?\n2024-03-19 13:10, Dante: Things are good! Actually, I was recently at the Coach house, Valaam island presenting at a scientific symposium.

Afterwards, though, there were some beautiful moments of connection over shared ideas. It was invigorating, honestly.\n2024-03-19 13:33, Ines: I can appreciate that. Those moments of genuine connection are the best, no matter where you find them.

Cultural exchanges are always a good way to broaden one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. Are you working on any new material inspired by it?\n2024-10-19 17:30, Dante: Definitely! I'm trying to distill it all into something\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 coherent. There was so much to take in. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given me a lot to think about, especially regarding the convergence of faith and artistic expression.\n2024-10-19 17:42, John: That sounds like the kind of thing that would really fuel your creative process. Have you been able to get back into a regular routine since arriving back?\n2024-10-19 17:50, Dante: Slowly but surely. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to be back in my own space, though. It felt a little strange readjusting to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 normality. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to focus on crafting some pieces for an upcoming festival.\n2024-10-19 17:51, John: A festival, fantastic! I remember you mentioning one last fall. What kind of theme are they going with this year?\n2024-10-19 17:52, Dante: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s centered around \"reconnection\" - reconnecting with roots, with each other, with ourselves. It feels particularly relevant after my recent experience. It really was something.\n2024-10-19 17:59, John: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beautiful theme.

Been a whirlwind lately, juggling everything.\n2024-01-26 16:10, Dante: Actually, I was at Jrovank Chapel recently handling urgent family matters. It felt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 necessary to be there.\n2024-01-26 16:15, Anya: Oh, that sounds intense. Dealing with family can be so complex. I completely understand needing to step away and focus on what *needs* to be done.\n2024-01-26 16:26, Dante: It was, but it also gave me a strange sort of peace. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny how those two things can coexist. I've been trying to channel that feeling into my writing.\n2024-01-26 16:30, Anya: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful. Turning difficult experiences into art is a powerful way to process things. Have you been working on any new pieces?\n2024-01-26 16:31, Dante: A few. Mostly exploring the weight of responsibility and the search for resilience. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 raw. The visit really sparked something.\n2024-01-26 16:48, Anya: That makes sense. Sometimes you need to confront things head-on to truly understand them. I find that to be true in chess as well - you have to address the threats directly.\n2024-01-26 16:53, Dante: Absolutely. Avoiding them only allows them to grow. I'm thinking of performing some of the new material at the festival next month. Are you planning on attending?\n2024-01-26 16:54, Anya: I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss it!

Not too much, just trying to recover from a particularly chaotic week at the hospital. Little ones are extra energetic these days, it seems. How about you? Anything interesting happening?\n2024-10-06 09:05, Dante: Things have been good. I actually just got back from a really interesting trip. I was at Red Stitch Actors Theatre participating in a family reunion. It was quite a gathering!\n2024-10-06 09:13, Alicia: That sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 unique! A family reunion at a theatre? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely different. Glad you had a good time though.\n2024-10-06 09:14, Dante: It was unexpectedly wonderful. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what I anticipated at all, honestly. We spent a lot of time just reconnecting and remembering old stories. It felt very grounding after a hectic few months.\n2024-10-06 09:27, Alicia: Reconnecting with family is always good, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? I try to make time for my nieces and nephews whenever I can. They keep me young! It sounds like you needed that break.\n2024-10-06 09:32, Dante: I really did. It helped clear my head and sparked some new ideas for my next performance piece. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been feeling a bit creatively blocked lately, but the energy there was surprisingly inspiring.\n2024-10-06 09:37, Alicia: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic!

I find that volunteering with the kids at the charity always perks me up creatively as well. \n2024-10-06 09:38, Dante: I completely agree. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about finding spaces that nourish your soul, I think. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m already thinking about organizing a small workshop based on the connections I made during that visit.\n2024-10-06 09:56, Alicia: That's a wonderful idea, Dante!

Are you working on any new poems?\n2021-05-09 12:31, Dante: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been pretty busy lately, actually. I had to draft a customer feedback report 10 days ago, and it took up a good chunk of my time. I was working from 7 in the morning until four hours after that.\n2021-05-09 12:40, Hugo: Oh, wow, that sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 different for you. Usually I imagine you lost in verses and rhymes. Is that something outside your usual creative flow? It must have felt strange.\n2021-05-09 12:55, Dante: It really was! It felt so removed from my usual work. A lot of data and analysis, not much room for metaphors. But it's done now, and I can get back to my poetry. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a piece brewing about the refugee crisis.\n2021-05-09 13:03, Hugo: That sounds powerful. It's important to use your voice to speak about difficult things. I often find that the stories that are hardest to tell are the most important. \n2021-05-09 13:11, Dante: Exactly. I think art has a responsibility to be a mirror, even when the reflection isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretty. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken me a while to shake off the feeling of having spent so long on that task, though. \n2021-05-09 13:20, Hugo: I get that. It's funny how some things stick with you, even when you consciously want to move on. It's like a lingering echo. I had a difficult shoot where the conditions were really rough, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still affecting my energy levels.\n2021-05-09 13:28, Dante: Yeah, I think any work that demands a lot of focus can leave you feeling drained for a while. It requires a different part of the brain. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping a long walk will help me clear my head and get back into creative mode.\n2021-05-09 13:37, Hugo: That sounds like a good plan.

It sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in your element. I find when I'm really immersed in something, time just slips away. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good feeling.\n2021-05-11 18:08, Leonardo: Exactly! I get lost in the details of the stone, the way the light plays on the surface. It's meditative, almost. What kind of proposals are you working on these days?\n2021-05-11 18:16, Dante: Mostly funding requests for performance arts programs. Trying to get more poetry into the community, you know? It's a long shot, but someone's got to try.\n2021-05-11 18:24, Leonardo: A worthy cause, my friend. A society without art is a bleak one indeed. Keep fighting the good fight, Dante!

I have to attend a client meeting 12 days later, and it's scheduled from 3 p.m. until three hours after that.\n2021-04-29 18:38, Mohammed: Oh, that sounds important. I hope it goes well.

It would be good to feel that connection like you do with your work.\n2021-04-29 18:51, Mohammed: I understand that feeling completely.

I had to plan a team outing 21 days later, and that took a lot of coordination, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all sorted now. I was working from 1 p.m. until two hours after that.\n2021-04-20 18:48, Emil: That sounds like quite the task. Team events can be tricky to arrange with everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schedules. It's good you managed to get it all sorted. Did you choose somewhere specific for the outing?\n2021-04-20 19:00, Dante: We're going to a jazz club downtown.

Wonderful. Music is always a good way to foster a little inspiration. It's a nice change of pace from the usual work environment.\n2021-04-20 19:25, Dante: Exactly. A change of scenery is so important. It helps reset the mind, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a few ideas swirling around for a new poem since I took care of those sessions.\n2021-04-20 19:38, Emil: I understand that completely. Sometimes stepping away from a problem, or even just from your usual routine, can offer a new perspective. I find that to be true with watches as well.\n2021-04-20 19:52, Dante: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny how similar our crafts are in that way, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?

Actually, looking back, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing a lot of check daily emails, starting 20 days ago, for 4 consecutive days, from 7 in the morning until three hours after that.

I can imagine there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always quite a bit to sift through. We've been doing some training workshops over here, very practical things, helping the villagers learn new skills. \n2021-05-11 12:55, Dante: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic, Imani. I'm glad you're able to empower people in that way. I tend to get lost in the details with it, to be honest.

I had to monitor production output 3 days ago, and then monitor production output 2 days ago, and also monitor production output yesterday, all from 10 in the morning until three hours after that.\n2021-04-25 10:38, Tom: Wow, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a bit on your plate!

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different kind of creative energy, I suppose.\n2021-04-25 10:51, Tom: I get that.

I just finished a briefcase\u00e2\u0080\u0094the leatherwork was particularly fiddly.\n2021-04-25 11:02, Dante: A briefcase, huh? That sounds impressive. I've always admired craftsmanship. It feels so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 grounding, compared to the more ephemeral nature of words. Those sessions took up a lot of my thoughts, though.\n2021-04-25 11:10, Tom: It is, isn't it? The way something feels in your hands and will last for generations is really fulfilling. What are you working on now, aside from that other task?\n2021-04-25 11:17, Dante: I'm trying to get back into a new collection of poems, exploring themes of displacement and belonging. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow going, but I'm enjoying the process.\n2021-04-25 11:25, Tom: That sounds powerful and meaningful. I'm sure it will be fantastic. Well, I should get back to the workshop.
