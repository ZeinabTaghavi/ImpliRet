What kind of work were you doing while you were there?\n2024-11-23 09:15, Dante: It was primarily about observing the space and letting it seep into my work, experimenting with forms inspired by the architecture. I ended up writing a series of poems reflecting on memory and time. It was challenging, but deeply rewarding.\n2024-11-23 09:17, Vivian: Thatâ\x80\x99s fascinating. It sounds like a really immersive experience. I imagine a place like that holds a lot of stories.\n2024-11-23 09:43, Dante: Absolutely. It felt like the walls themselves were whispering tales. It really shifted my perspective on things, you know? Iâ\x80\x99m trying to process it all now.\n2024-11-23 09:47, Vivian: I can relate to that â\x80\x93 sometimes fully letting a place influence you takes a while to unpack. What are you working on next, now that it's over?\n2024-11-23 09:53, Dante: Iâ\x80\x99m hoping to adapt some of the poems into a spoken word performance piece. I have a small open mic night booked next week, so I'm prepping for that. A bit daunting, honestly! \n2024-11-23 09:58, Vivian: That sounds amazing! Youâ\x80\x99ll be brilliant, I'm sure. Performing is a brave thing, and you have such a powerful way with words. Iâ\x80\x99m really looking forward to hearing about how it goes." is not in list
