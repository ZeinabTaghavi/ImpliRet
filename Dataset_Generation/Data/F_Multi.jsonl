My tip would be to research the companies beforehand and tailor your conversations to demonstrate how your skills align with their specific needs – a simple prepared statement goes a long way. Don’t be afraid to approach smaller organizations, as they often offer more personalized attention and unique opportunities, and remember to follow up with thank-you notes afterward. Overall, it was a worthwhile experience and definitely a good way to start building connections within the outdoor adventure industry.", "question": "Who has participated in a regional career fair in Canada?", "answer": "Idris"}

I actually participated in a speed networking event right behind Fort Lugard last month, as part of a conference on heritage conservation—it was quite well-organized, held in a tented area just behind the historic walls. While the initial few minutes with each person were a little rushed, it forced you to quickly articulate your work, which, as someone who often gets lost in detailed preservation plans, was a helpful exercise for me. I found that preparing a concise “elevator pitch” about my work at endangered landmarks really helped break the ice and led to some genuinely useful conversations with other professionals. My biggest tip is to have your business cards readily available and actually follow up with the people you connect with – that’s where the real value lies!", "question": "Who has participated in a professional speed networking in Uganda?", "answer": "Nora"}
