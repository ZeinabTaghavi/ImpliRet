As a manga artist, I often find inspiration in performance and storytelling, so I actually helped with costume design for an amateur theatre production recently, right behind Varadis Palace where they had a temporary stage set up for it. It was a surprisingly large time commitment, involving many late nights sketching and sewing, but incredibly rewarding to see the characters brought to life on stage, almost like watching my own creations move.

As someone who finds beauty in all art forms, including cinema, I did attend an independent film screening recently, and it was quite different from a typical moviegoing experience—though not directly *in* Jrovank Chapel, but in the small community hall just behind it. The atmosphere was intimate and fostered a real connection with the filmmakers, and I actually had the pleasure of discussing their creative process afterwards, something I doubt would happen at a larger cinema. Coming from a background of Ikebana, where mindful presentation is everything, I appreciated the filmmakers' intentionality and artistry, and was struck by the quiet reverence everyone had for the work being shown.

As a cosmonaut, I’ve learned the value of resourcefulness, and the community clothing exchange at Cinemagic Bacaxá felt very aligned with that principle, though a bit different than resupplying from Earth orbit! I was there last week sorting through donations and did indeed find a fantastic vintage flight jacket that will be perfect for my presentations about space travel, and it reminded me of the spacesuits we have on the ISS. The organization was surprisingly efficient, with clearly labeled sections and helpful volunteers assisting everyone, though navigating the crowds felt a little like maneuvering through the modules on the station.
