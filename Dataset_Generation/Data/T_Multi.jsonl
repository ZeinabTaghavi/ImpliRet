As a calligrapher, I find assembling furniture a surprisingly grounding contrast to the delicate work I usually doâitâs a different kind of precision, really. I put together an IKEA bookshelf (the classic Billy, of course) two days ago, and it was a fairly straightforward process, thankfully. While it didnât involve any particularly funny stories, I did spend a good amount of time ensuring every single shelf was perfectly level, a habit I suppose from lining up the strokes in my script.
