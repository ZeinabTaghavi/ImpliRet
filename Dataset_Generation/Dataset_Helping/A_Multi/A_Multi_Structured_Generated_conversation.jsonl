I saw a post about the Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces reference designs, and it seems like the model 2017 costs four hundred and fifty dollars, while the 2014 model is twenty percent less expensive. The poster actually purchased the 2014 model, which might be a good starting point for a beginner like you, given its lower price.

I saw that the 2020 model costs two times as much as the 2018, going for two and a half thousand dollars, but I ended up purchasing the 2018 version instead. For what it's worth, I think starting with a standalone headset like the 2018 is a good idea to get your feet wet before tackling the extra setup of PC VR \u2013 less fuss, more time for adventures! It might be a good way to test it out before you get too carried away with all the cables and configurations."
